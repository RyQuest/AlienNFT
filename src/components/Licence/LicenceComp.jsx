            need to pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use
            the Art; and (z) to the extent that Creator informs you of such
            additional restrictions in writing (email is permissible), you will
            be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the
            date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be
            deemed a breach of this license. The restriction in Section 4 will

            If your Purchased NFT is used by Womens NFT for sale of any
            merchandise, you will be paid a royalty of 20% on each sale.
            <br />
            &nbsp;
            <br />
            Where multiple artworks are used in a merchandise, the 20% royalties
            will be shared proportionately between all owners. For avoidance of
            doubt, if a merchandise contains 10 Womens NFT NFTs that are owned
            by 10 unique owners, the 20% royalties will be shared between the
            10, therefore each owner receiving their share of 2% royalties.
            <br />
            &nbsp;
            <br />
            Womens NFT will maintain the record of all sales and royalty
            payments will be made on a quarterly basis. <br />
